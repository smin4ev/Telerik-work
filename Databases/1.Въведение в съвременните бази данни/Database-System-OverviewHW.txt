1.What database models do you know?
	-Hierarchical (tree)
	-Network/graph
	-Relational(table)
	-Object-oriented

2.Which are the main functions performed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?
	-Creating / altering / deleting tables and relationships between them (database schema)
	-Adding, changing, deleting, searching and retrieving of data stored in the tables
	-Support for the SQL language

3.Define what is "table" in database terms.
	-A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. 
	It consists of fields (columns), and rows.table is a set of data elements (values) using a 
	model of vertical columns (which are identified by their name) and horizontal rows, the cell
	being the unit where a row and column intersect.[2] A table has a specified number of columns, 
	but can have any number of rows.[3] Each row is identified by the values appearing in a particular 
	column subset which has been identified as a unique key index.

4.Explain the difference between a primary and a foreign key.
	-Primary key and foreign key are located in one table (two different columns). 
	-Primary key is a column of the table that uniquely identifies its rows (usually its is a number)
	-The foreign key is an identifier of a record located in another table (usually its primary key)
	
5.Explain the different kinds of relationships between tables in relational databases.
	-Relationships between tables are based on interconnections: primary key / foreign key 

		*Relationship one-to-many (or many-to-one) - A single record in the first 
		table has many corresponding records in the second table

		*Relationship many-to-many - Records in the first table have many corresponding 
		records in the second one and vice versa.Implemented through additional table

		*Relationship one-to-one - A single record in a table corresponds to a single record in the other table

6.When is a certain database schema normalized? What are the advantages of normalized databases?
	-Database is normalized when there is no repeating data. Advantages of normalized database are many:

		*It makes the process of changing the data in a table for a lot if its components easier, 
		because normalising a database enables the user to create relationship strands between 
		the pieces of information

		*Normalisation helps to reduce redundancy rates within companies because when a 
		database is normalised, it pulls out all the abnormal factors to do with workers 
		that do not fit in to the general consensus of the company. 

		*Normalisation can also be handy in finding anomalies within data. For example, if 
		an employee recently changed addresses, but only one of the databases that they are 
		on is updated, normalisation would recognise this as abnormal and flag the issue up to human resources. 

7.What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?
	-Integrity constraints ensure data integrity in the database tables. They are used when user want to be sure
	that database element (or elements) are within certain limits or to comply with a particular condition


8.Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database.
	-Indices speed up searching of values in a certain column or group of columns 
	-Indices can be built-in the table (clustered) or stored externally (non-clustered)
	-Indices can be built-in the table (clustered) or stored externally (non-clustered) - should be 
	use for big tables only - 50000 rows


9.What's the main purpose of the SQL language?
	-SQL (Structured Query Language) is standardized declarative language for manipulation of relational databases
	
10.What are transactions used for? Give an example.
	-Transactions are a sequence of database operations which are executed as a single unit:
		*Either all of them execute successfully
		*Or none of them is executed at all
	-Transaction are used when user want to be sure that all activities in a procedure are done
	-Example - A bank transfer from one account into another (withdrawal + deposit) - If either the withdrawal 
	or the deposit fails the entire operation should be cancelled

11.What is a NoSQL database?
	-NoSQL - non-relational databases
	-Use document-based model (non-relational)
	-A NoSQL or Not Only SQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that 
	is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
12.Explain the classical non-relational data models.
	-NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications.
	NoSQL systems are also called "Not only SQL" to emphasize that they may also support 
	SQL-like query languages. Many NoSQL stores compromise consistency (in the sense of the CAP theorem) 
	in favor of availability and partition tolerance. Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL stores 
	include the use of low-level query languages, the lack of standardized interfaces, and huge 
	investments in existing SQL.Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions, although a few recent 
	systems, such as FairCom c-treeACE, Google Spanner and FoundationDB, have made them central to their designs.
13.Give few examples of NoSQL databases and their pros and cons.
	-Document model - Set of documents, e.g. JSON strings
	-Key-value model - Set of key-value pairs
	-Hierarchical key-value - Hierarchy of key-value pairs
	-Wide-column model - Key-value model with schema
